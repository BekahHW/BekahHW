## Hey! I'm BekahHW!
I'm a 2019 Flatiron School bootcamp grad, and since then I've started a consultancy specializing in front-end development, created the developer community called Virtual Coffee, continued to prolifically tweet, spoken on podcasts and at conferences, and continued to mom my four kids.  In my previous life, I spent 10 years teaching college English and three years organizing events and community. I fully embrace being a writer of many genres: code, non-fiction, screenplay, poetry, curriculum.
