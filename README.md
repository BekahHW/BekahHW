## Hey! I'm BekahHW!
I'm a 2019 Flatiron School bootcamp grad, and since then, I've started a consultancy specializing in front-end development, created the developer community called Virtual Coffee, continued to prolifically tweet, spoken on podcasts and at conferences, and continued to mom my four kids.  Beyond my tech experience, I've spent ten years teaching college English and seven years organizing events and community. I fully embrace being a writer of many genres: code, non-fiction, screenplay, poetry, curriculum, and a [YA book coming November 2024](https://www.siblingswrite.com/).
